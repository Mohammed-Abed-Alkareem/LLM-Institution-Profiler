These centres pool their expertise and collaborate on research projects that address real-world supply chain and logistics challenges, helping companies worldwide navigate an increasingly complex business environment.</p>\n<p>“Loughborough University’s exceptional research capabilities and commitment to supply chain innovation make it a valuable addition to the MIT Global SCALE Network,” said Professor Yossi Sheffi, Director of MIT CTL. “Their expertise will enhance our collective ability to create cutting-edge solutions and educate the next generation of supply chain leaders.”</p>\n<p>Loughborough University will join the network alongside existing centres: MIT CTL, the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC, Spain), the Center for Latin-American Logistics Innovation (CLI, Colombia), the Luxembourg Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LCL), and the Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation (NISCI).</p>\n<p>The four university centres (MIT, ZLC, LCL, and NISCI) offer their own master’s programs, while CLI offers a Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (GCLOG).

These centres pool their expertise and collaborate on research projects that address real-world supply chain and logistics challenges, helping companies worldwide navigate an increasingly complex business environment.</p>\n<p>“Loughborough University’s exceptional research capabilities and commitment to supply chain innovation make it a valuable addition to the MIT Global SCALE Network,” said Professor Yossi Sheffi, Director of MIT CTL. “Their expertise will enhance our collective ability to create cutting-edge solutions and educate the next generation of supply chain leaders.”</p>\n<p>Loughborough University will join the network alongside existing centres: MIT CTL, the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC, Spain), the Center for Latin-American Logistics Innovation (CLI, Colombia), the Luxembourg Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LCL), and the Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation (NISCI).</p>\n<p>The four university centres (MIT, ZLC, LCL, and NISCI) offer their own master’s programs, while CLI offers a Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (GCLOG).

(L-R) Professor Rachel Thompson, Professor Eric Grimson, Professor Yossi Sheffi, Professor Nick Jennings and Professor Jan Godsell\nThe union will offer an exclusive Master's degree program for hundreds of students each year, with time divided between both Loughborough and Massachusetts, in the United States.\nThe centre itself will focus on research and working with industry and will join the established SCALE Network which is already operating around the world in countries such as Spain, Luxembourg, China and Colombia.\nProfessor Jan Godsell, Dean of [Loughborough Business School](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/business-school/), said: “The UK is a small island so we have to think very carefully about how we ensure everybody in our country has access to the things that they need, when they need them, at a price that they can afford.\n\"The centre will be the go-to place to develop the next generation of supply chain talent.\n\"We're bringing our expertise, particularly around the circular economy and also digitisation – and at its core is a flagship MSc program in supply chain, which involves time in Boston at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and an MIT certificate as well as a Loughborough degree.”\nLoughborough’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Nick Jennings added: “Our partnership with MIT CTL really helps put us on a global stage - it's a great partnership with a world-class university.”\nThe endeavour marks a significant expansion of the network, an international alliance of leading research and education centres dedicated to driving supply chain and logistics innovation through global collaboration.\nWith the inclusion of Loughborough University, the MIT Global SCALE Network now comprises six Centres of Excellence across four continents. These centres pool their expertise and collaborate on research projects that address real-world supply chain and logistics challenges, helping companies worldwide navigate an increasingly complex business environment.\n“Loughborough University’s exceptional research capabilities and commitment to supply chain innovation make it a valuable addition to the MIT Global SCALE Network,” said Professor Yossi Sheffi, Director of MIT CTL. “Their expertise will enhance our collective ability to create cutting-edge solutions and educate the next generation of supply chain leaders.”\nLoughborough University will join the network alongside existing centres: MIT CTL, the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC, Spain), the Center for Latin-American Logistics Innovation (CLI, Colombia), the Luxembourg Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LCL), and the Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation (NISCI).\nThe four university centres (MIT, ZLC, LCL, and NISCI) offer their own master’s programs, while CLI offers a Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (GCLOG). Together, these centres offer a comprehensive curriculum in supply chain management, fostering a global community of bold thinkers from both industry and academia.\n“Joining the MIT Global SCALE Network is a tremendous opportunity for Loughborough University,” said Professor Ken Lee, Director of Postgraduate studies at Loughborough Business School. “I am particularly excited at the opportunity for our students to experience the unique MIT culture and interact with inspiring faculty and research during their time in Boston. “\nThe MIT Global SCALE Network was established in 2003 with the inauguration of the Zaragoza Logistics Center in Spain. Since then, it has expanded to include centres in Colombia, Luxembourg, China, and now the United Kingdom. The network supports over a dozen educational programs, engages more than 80 researchers and faculty, partners with 150 corporations, and boasts an alumni network of over 1200 professionals worldwide.\nOrganisations partnering with the MIT Global SCALE Network gain unparalleled access to expertise, innovative research, and a unique forum for knowledge exchange, while the network’s centres and students benefit from rich industry engagement and collaborative opportunities.\n_For more information, please visit:_\n**ENDS**\n#### Notes for editors\nPress release reference number: 24/86\nLoughborough is one of the country’s leading universities, with an international reputation for research that matters, excellence in teaching, strong links with industry, and unrivalled achievement in sport and its underpinning academic disciplines. \nIt has been awarded five stars in the independent QS Stars university rating scheme and named the best university in the world for sports-related subjects in the 2024 QS World University Rankings – the eighth year running. \nLoughborough is ranked 6th in The UK Complete University Guide 2025, 10th in the Guardian University League Table 2024 and 10th in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2024. \nLoughborough is consistently ranked in the top twenty of UK universities in the Times Higher Education’s ‘table of tables’, and in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 over 90% of its research was rated as ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally-excellent’.

These centres pool their expertise and collaborate on research projects that address real-world supply chain and logistics challenges, helping companies worldwide navigate an increasingly complex business environment.\n“Loughborough University’s exceptional research capabilities and commitment to supply chain innovation make it a valuable addition to the MIT Global SCALE Network,” said Professor Yossi Sheffi, Director of MIT CTL. “Their expertise will enhance our collective ability to create cutting-edge solutions and educate the next generation of supply chain leaders.”\nLoughborough University will join the network alongside existing centres: MIT CTL, the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC, Spain), the Center for Latin-American Logistics Innovation (CLI, Colombia), the Luxembourg Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LCL), and the Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation (NISCI).\nThe four university centres (MIT, ZLC, LCL, and NISCI) offer their own master’s programs, while CLI offers a Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (GCLOG). Together, these centres offer a comprehensive curriculum in supply chain management, fostering a global community of bold thinkers from both industry and academia.\n“Joining the MIT Global SCALE Network is a tremendous opportunity for Loughborough University,” said Professor Ken Lee, Director of Postgraduate studies at Loughborough Business School. “I am particularly excited at the opportunity for our students to experience the unique MIT culture and interact with inspiring faculty and research during their time in Boston. “\nThe MIT Global SCALE Network was established in 2003 with the inauguration of the Zaragoza Logistics Center in Spain. Since then, it has expanded to include centres in Colombia, Luxembourg, China, and now the United Kingdom. The network supports over a dozen educational programs, engages more than 80 researchers and faculty, partners with 150 corporations, and boasts an alumni network of over 1200 professionals worldwide.\nOrganisations partnering with the MIT Global SCALE Network gain unparalleled access to expertise, innovative research, and a unique forum for knowledge exchange, while the network’s centres and students benefit from rich industry engagement and collaborative opportunities.\n_For more information, please visit:_\n**ENDS**\n#### Notes for editors\nPress release reference number: 24/86\nLoughborough is one of the country’s leading universities, with an international reputation for research that matters, excellence in teaching, strong links with industry, and unrivalled achievement in sport and its underpinning academic disciplines. \nIt has been awarded five stars in the independent QS Stars university rating scheme and named the best university in the world for sports-related subjects in the 2024 QS World University Rankings – the eighth year running. \nLoughborough is ranked 6th in The UK Complete University Guide 2025, 10th in the Guardian University League Table 2024 and 10th in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2024. \nLoughborough is consistently ranked in the top twenty of UK universities in the Times Higher Education’s ‘table of tables’, and in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 over 90% of its research was rated as ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally-excellent’.

These centres pool their expertise and collaborate on research projects that address real-world supply chain and logistics challenges, helping companies worldwide navigate an increasingly complex business environment.\n“Loughborough University’s exceptional research capabilities and commitment to supply chain innovation make it a valuable addition to the MIT Global SCALE Network,” said Professor Yossi Sheffi, Director of MIT CTL. “Their expertise will enhance our collective ability to create cutting-edge solutions and educate the next generation of supply chain leaders.”\nLoughborough University will join the network alongside existing centres: MIT CTL, the Zaragoza Logistics Center (ZLC, Spain), the Center for Latin-American Logistics Innovation (CLI, Colombia), the Luxembourg Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management (LCL), and the Ningbo China Institute for Supply Chain Innovation (NISCI).\nThe four university centres (MIT, ZLC, LCL, and NISCI) offer their own master’s programs, while CLI offers a Graduate Certificate in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (GCLOG). Together, these centres offer a comprehensive curriculum in supply chain management, fostering a global community of bold thinkers from both industry and academia.\n“Joining the MIT Global SCALE Network is a tremendous opportunity for Loughborough University,” said Professor Ken Lee, Director of Postgraduate studies at Loughborough Business School. “I am particularly excited at the opportunity for our students to experience the unique MIT culture and interact with inspiring faculty and research during their time in Boston. “\nThe MIT Global SCALE Network was established in 2003 with the inauguration of the Zaragoza Logistics Center in Spain. Since then, it has expanded to include centres in Colombia, Luxembourg, China, and now the United Kingdom. The network supports over a dozen educational programs, engages more than 80 researchers and faculty, partners with 150 corporations, and boasts an alumni network of over 1200 professionals worldwide.\nOrganisations partnering with the MIT Global SCALE Network gain unparalleled access to expertise, innovative research, and a unique forum for knowledge exchange, while the network’s centres and students benefit from rich industry engagement and collaborative opportunities.\n_For more information, please visit:_\n**ENDS**\n#### Notes for editors\nPress release reference number: 24/86\nLoughborough is one of the country’s leading universities, with an international reputation for research that matters, excellence in teaching, strong links with industry, and unrivalled achievement in sport and its underpinning academic disciplines. \nIt has been awarded five stars in the independent QS Stars university rating scheme and named the best university in the world for sports-related subjects in the 2024 QS World University Rankings – the eighth year running. \nLoughborough is ranked 6th in The UK Complete University Guide 2025, 10th in the Guardian University League Table 2024 and 10th in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2024. \nLoughborough is consistently ranked in the top twenty of UK universities in the Times Higher Education’s ‘table of tables’, and in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 over 90% of its research was rated as ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally-excellent’.
